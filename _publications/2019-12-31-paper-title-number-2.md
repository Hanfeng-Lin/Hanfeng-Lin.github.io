<b>Abstract</b>

Yuan-Hu, the dried tubers of Corydalis yanhusuo W.T. Wang, is a classic herb frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine, with the efficacy of promoting blood circulation, revitalizing and analgesia. The corresponding bioactive ingredients are mainly benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs), whose biosynthetic pathway has been extensively studied. However, few studies have paid attention to BIA biosynthetic pathway in C. yanhusuo, leading to the inexplicit mechanism on synthesizing specific chemicals in C. yanhusuo. Previous study was based on the transcriptome data retrieved from next-generation sequencing technology and the unigenes assembled from short reads cannot represent the full-length transcripts. Based on hybrid-seq of C. yanhusuo, we identified 90 full-length transcripts involved in BIA-biosynthesis. Moreover, we herein demonstrate that tetrahydroberberine and tetrahydropalmatine, two representative BIAs in C. yanhusuo, accumulates in the root system, which accords with the expression pattern of identified BIA-biosynthetic unigenes in tubers and leaves. According to phylogenetic analysis, we predicted that a total of ten enzymes may contain the columbamine-O-methyltranferring activity, the final step for tetrahydropalmatine synthesis. Our results provide a new insight into the BIA-biosynthesis pathway and its regulation among different organs. Further molecular cloning of such enzymes and activity validation studies could be conducted from our full-length transcriptomic information.
