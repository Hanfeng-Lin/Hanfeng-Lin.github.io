* Hi, I am Hanfeng Lin
 
* I am a 3+1 student of China Pharmaceutical University (CPU) and University of Strathclyde (UoS). My program in CPU is Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy and my major in UoS is Biochemistry and Pharmacology (Honours). Currently, I am doing my graduation thesis supervised by *******.
 
 
* I have systematically studied professional courses in Pharmacy and maintained top 1 in my class since freshman year, and I was awarded the “Triple-A Student” honor, the First-class Scholarships, and National Scholarship for many times. By actively engaging in lab researches and writing reports, I have also mastered a series of lab techniques (PCR, Western-blot, Cell culture, Protein purification, Transcriptomic analysis, etc), familiarized with statistics software (SPSS, Origin, Graphpad) and illustration (Photoshop, AI, R), and strengthened skill in literature review.
 
* As a quick learner, I like to take a crack at new things in different fields and enjoy the feeling of gaining knowledge. Driven by great self-discipline and internal motivation, I am capable of learning independently. What is more, I am a considerate and open-minded person who is good at working as part of a team and dealing with diverse people.
 
 
* My research interest is revealing the molecular interaction between protein and macromolecules (DNA, RNA) or small molecules (drug, endogenous ligand) via biophysic methods.
 
* To learn more about me, you can have a view of my CV page <a href="https://hanfeng-lin.github.io/cv/">here</a>, or download my resume here.
 
* I like writing blogs to summarize the knowledge or record my interesting experiments. I like sharing and discussing things with others. Visit my Chinese blog <a href="https://weibo.com/5979426299/profile">here</a>!
