Education
======
* China Pharmaceutical University (CPU), Nanjing, China   09/2016 - 06/2020
  * B.S. in Pharmacy (Biochemistry and Pharmacology)      GPA: 3.88/4.0
* University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK (anticipated)    09/2019 - 06/2020
  * BSc in Biochemistry and Pharmacology

Research Experience
======
* 06/2019 - 08/2019 <i>Investigator</i>, <b>IGEM: Blue Light Detecting Strain Based on Cas1-Cas2</b>
  * Instructed by Dr. Yibei Xiao	
  * Construct of the blue-light sensitizing protein (YF1, FixJ) on the plasmid and gene expression
  * Construct the promoter that can bind to the blue-light sensitizing protein on the upstream of plasmid Cas3. (Cas3 could inhibit the continuous expression of Cas1-Cas2 on another plasmid, thus inhibiting the space acquisition process of CRISPR array.)
  * Deduce the blue light exposure time and intensity of the strain through PCR amplifying CRISPR array.

* 03/2019 - 09/2019 <i>Investigator</i>, <b>Identification of Benzyl Isoquinoline Alkaloids (BIA) Genes in Corydalis by Full-length Transcriptome Data Analysis</b>
  * Instructed by Dr. Yucheng Zhao 
  * Obtain the first full-length transcription group of Corydalis, analyze the related transcripts of enzymes and verified that all BIA -synthetic proteins in Corydalis root had their corresponding mRNA
  * Classify O-methyltransferase (OMT) protein family by constructing phylogenetic tree  
  * A first-author research paper under peer-review
  
* 03/2019 - 08/2019 <i>Investigator</i>, <b>Biophysical Study on Proteins Related to CRISPR System and Their Activities	</b>
  * Instructed by Dr.Yibei Xiao
  * Construct the expression strains and purify key proteins Cas9, Cas1, Csn2 and Cas13a in CRISPR system 
  * Obtain RNA by in-vitro transcription of spacer cDNA sequences using purified T7 transcriptase, and research their binding and activity 
  * Analyze the structure of the complexes with biophysical methods (X-ray crystallography)

* 05/2018 - 04/2019 <i>Project leader</i>, <b>Effect of Tripeptidase Gene Knockout by Red Recombinant System on Glutathione Biosynthesis</b>
Instructed by Dr. Jiyang Xu            
  * Constructed engineering bacteria pET28a-gsh I and pBAD24-gsh II, screened positive recombinant ions and knock out the tripeptidase gene by using Red recombination system 
  * Inhibited the expression of tripeptidase and GSH degradation, determined the content of GSH by alloxan method
  * Compared data of the glutathione production from the knockout strain and constructed strain, verified knocking out the tripeptidase gene could increase the GSH production

* 09/2018 - 12/2018 <i>Co-investigator</i>, <b>Effects of Sodium Valerate on Endothelial Stem Progenitor Cells in Rats with Uremic Heart Failure	</b>
  * Worked with seniors to induced rat chronic renal failure (CRF) model by conducting nephrectomy 
  * Determined hemodynamics, in vitro vascular ring diastolic, renal index and cardiac index
  * Provided some data and basis for the clinical application of sodium valproate
