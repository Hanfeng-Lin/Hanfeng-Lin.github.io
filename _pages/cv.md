Education
======
* China Pharmaceutical University (CPU), Nanjing, China   09/2016-06/2020
  B.S. in Pharmacy (Biochemistry and Pharmacology)      GPA: 3.88/4.0
* University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, UK (anticipated)    09/2019-06/2020
  BSc in Biochemistry and Pharmacology

Research experience
======
*06/2019-08/2019 IGEM: Blue Light Detecting Strain Based on Cas1-Cas2
  *Instructed by Dr. Yibei Xiao	
  *Construct of the blue-light sensitizing protein (YF1, FixJ) on the plasmid and gene expression
  *Construct the promoter that can bind to the blue-light sensitizing protein on the upstream of plasmid Cas3. (Cas3 could inhibit the continuous expression of Cas1-Cas2 on another plasmid, thus inhibiting the space acquisition process of CRISPR array.)
  *Deduce the blue light exposure time and intensity of the strain through PCR amplifying CRISPR array.

*03/2019-09/2019 Identification of Benzyl Isoquinoline Alkaloids (BIA) Genes in Corydalis by Full-length Transcriptome Data Analysis	
  *Instructed by Dr. Yucheng Zhao 
  *Obtain the first full-length transcription group of Corydalis, analyze the related transcripts of enzymes and verified that all BIA -synthetic proteins in Corydalis root had their corresponding mRNA
  *Classify O-methyltransferase (OMT) protein family by constructing phylogenetic tree  
  *A first-author research paper under peer-review
  
*03/2019-08/2019 Biophysical Study on Proteins Related to CRISPR System and Their Activities	
  *Instructed by Dr.Yibei Xiao
  *Construct the expression strains and purify key proteins Cas9, Cas1, Csn2 and Cas13a in CRISPR system 
  *Obtain RNA by in-vitro transcription of spacer cDNA sequences using purified T7 transcriptase, and research their binding and activity 
  *Analyze the structure of the complexes with biophysical methods (X-ray crystallography)

*05/2018-04/2019 Project leader, Effect of Tripeptidase Gene Knockout by Red Recombinant System on Glutathione Biosynthesis
Instructed by Dr. Jiyang Xu            
  *Constructed engineering bacteria pET28a-gsh I and pBAD24-gsh II, screened positive recombinant ions and knock out the tripeptidase gene by using Red recombination system 
  *Inhibited the expression of tripeptidase and GSH degradation, determined the content of GSH by alloxan method
  *Compared data of the glutathione production from the knockout strain and constructed strain, verified knocking out the tripeptidase gene could increase the GSH production

*09/2018-12/2018 Co-investigator, Effects of Sodium Valerate on Endothelial Stem Progenitor Cells in Rats with Uremic Heart Failure	
  *Worked with seniors to induced rat chronic renal failure (CRF) model by conducting nephrectomy 
  *Determined hemodynamics, in vitro vascular ring diastolic, renal index and cardiac index
  *Provided some data and basis for the clinical application of sodium valproate
